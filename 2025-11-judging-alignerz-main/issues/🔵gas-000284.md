# [000284] Variables Should Be Immutable or Have Setter Functions
  
  ## Gas Optimisation
### Summary

The `A26ZDividendDistributor.sol` contract has two variables that are never updated. They should be declared as immutable or the contract should have setter functions to update them need be. 

### Root Cause

In the `A26ZDividendDistributor.sol` contract we have the following variables:

```solidity
/// @notice vesting interface
    IAlignerzVesting public vesting; 

    /// @notice nft interface
    IAlignerzNFT public nft;
```

Theses are not updated at any point. There are no setter functions to update them if there is a change in the usage of those contracts. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There is no attack path in a Gas optimisation finding. N/A

### Impact

**Impact:** (LOW) <br> Making these variables immutable will save gas. 

**Likelihood:** (HIGH) <br> This will always cost the contract more gas

### PoC

There is no need for a runnable PoC in this case

### Mitigation

Declare the two variables as immutable or consider adding setters. Especially for the upgradable contract.
