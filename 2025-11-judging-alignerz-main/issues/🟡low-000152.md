# [000152] Users can collude to avoid paying fees
  
  The contract charges a flat bidFee for each new bid, regardless of its size. Because there is no maximum bid limit, a single user or a group of colluding users can place one extremely large bid to buy out an entire sale.

By doing so, they only pay the flat bidFee once. This allows them to get through the token sale while minimizing fees paid to the protocol, which would otherwise collect more revenue from multiple, smaller bidders.
