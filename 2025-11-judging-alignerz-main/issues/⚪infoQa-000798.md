# [000798] Lack of Validation on `vestingPeriod` Allows Setting Zero Value, Causing Division-by-Zero Reverts
  
  ### Summary

The lack of validation on the `vestingPeriod` value will cause a loss of functionality for users as the owner can set `vestingPeriod = 0`, which will make multiple functions revert due to a division-by-zero attack path.

### Root Cause

In `DividendDistributor.sol:setVestingPeriod` the contract does not validate the newly provided `vestingPeriod` value, allowing it to be set to zero. This results in downstream calculations dividing by `vestingPeriod`, causing unavoidable reverts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This is not an attack, it's informational.

1. **Owner** calls `setVestingPeriod(0)`.
2. The contract updates `vestingPeriod` to zero without checks.
3. Any user later calling functions such as `claimDividends`, `getUnclaimedAmounts`, `getTotalUnclaimedAmounts`, `_setAmounts`, `setUpTheDividends`, or `setAmounts` triggers logic that computes `amount * seconds / vestingPeriod`.
4. Since `vestingPeriod = 0`, these calls revert with a division-by-zero error, making core functionality inaccessible.


### Impact

The users cannot claim dividends or interact with vesting-related functions, as all calculations involving `vestingPeriod` revert. This results in a complete loss of functionality until the owner resets the value to a non-zero number.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate the input in `setVestingPeriod` by enforcing `vestingPeriod > 0`.
This ensures the contract never enters a broken state caused by division-by-zero operations.
