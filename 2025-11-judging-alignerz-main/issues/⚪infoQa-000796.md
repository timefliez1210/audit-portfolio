# [000796] EndTimeHash Can Be Easily Brute-Forced, Failing to Conceal Actual End Time
  
  ### Summary

Using a raw hash of the `endTime` without sufficient entropy will cause ineffective obfuscation for all bidders as any user will brute-force the real end time by hashing all possible timestamps within a reasonable future range.

### Root Cause

In AlignerzVesting.sol: launchBiddingProject(), the `endTimeHash` is computed only as `keccak256(endTime)` without a salt, making the value reversible via brute-forcing of all likely timestamps.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This is not an attack, it's informational.
1. A user observes the publicly emitted `endTimeHash` for a bidding project.
2. The user brute-forces all possible timestamps in the next weeks or months (e.g., iterating over 2.6M seconds per month).
3. The attacker computes `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(candidateTimestamp))` for each second.
4. Once a match is found, the attacker learns the previously hidden `endTime`.

### Impact

The project creators cannot effectively hide the `endTime`, as any user can recover it with negligible computational effort. This does not result in direct financial loss but breaks the intended secrecy assumptions of the bidding process.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a commit-reveal scheme with a salted hash, e.g., `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(endTime, secretSalt))`, and reveal the salt only after bids close. Alternatively, remove the hash-based concealment if secrecy of the end time is not critical.
