# [000782] Missing Event Emissions in Fund Withdrawal Functions
  
  ### Summary

The absence of event emissions will cause incomplete transaction logging for the protocol team and external monitoring systems as the owner withdraws stuck funds without emitting events that document these transfers.

### Root Cause

In `AlignerzVesting:withdrawStuckTokens`, `AlignerzVesting:withdrawStuckETH`, and `A26ZDividendDistributor:withdrawStuckTokens` , the functions lack event emissions when transferring funds out of the contract. This makes it impossible for off-chain systems, frontend interfaces, and monitoring tools to reliably track and audit these fund movements.


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

It's not an attack, it's informational.

1. Owner calls `withdrawStuckTokens` to recover accidentally transferred tokens or `withdrawStuckETH` to recover accidentally transferred ETH
2. The function successfully transfers the funds to the owner's address
3. No event is emitted to record this action
4. Off-chain monitoring systems, auditors, and block explorers have no indexed event to track this withdrawal
5. The transaction history becomes opaque and difficult to verify without manually parsing raw transaction data


### Impact

The protocol suffers from inability to audit fund movements transparently. While there is no direct financial loss, the lack of event emissions violates best practices for contract transparency and prevents external systems from tracking the fund recovery, making it difficult for stakeholders to verify the integrity of fund management operations.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add event definitions and emissions to all three functions.
This ensures all fund withdrawals are properly logged and queryable by external systems and auditors.
