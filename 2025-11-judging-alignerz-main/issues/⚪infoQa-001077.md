# [001077] Missing Zero-Address Validation for token in Dividend Distributor Constructor
  
  ### Summary

The constructor of `A26ZDividendDistributor` does not validate that the `_token` parameter is non-zero. This allows deployment with a zero address as the project token, which breaks token-matching logic inside the distributor and causes all dividend calculations for NFTs to behave incorrectly.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/dualguard/2025-11-alignerz/blob/f7eeed88d91356484c02af6f38b71f27b790828c/protocol/src/contracts/A26ZDividendDistributor/A26ZDividendDistributor.sol#L79

The constructor checks `_vesting`, `_nft`, and `_stablecoin` but does not check `_token`, allowing:
```solidity
A26ZDividendDistributor(..., address(0))
```
This breaks logic such as:
```solidity
if (address(token) == address(vesting.allocationOf(nftId).token)) return 0;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin deploys `A26ZDividendDistributor` with `_token = address(0)` (by mistake).
2. Dividends are initialized using `setUpTheDividends()`.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owner deploys the distributor contract, accidentally passing _token = 0x000...0.
2. Dividend logic runs, but token-matching always fails or always returns zero.

### Impact

This is NOT exploitable by attackers, but the protocol can unintentionally brick dividend distribution for a project by deploying the distributor with an invalid token address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a address-zero check in constructor
