# [000753] `placeBid` has no pause  protection
  
  
### Summary

`placeBid` allows bidding at any time the project window is open and the contract uses whatever `stablecoin` the owner configured, without any pause hook or oracle check, so depegged  stablecoins can still be used for bidding.

### Root Cause

In `AlignerzVesting.sol:708-735` the function only checks project timing, whitelist, and basic amount/vesting constraints and then pulls `amount` via `biddingProject.stablecoin.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);` without any `whenNotPaused` or price validity check.

### Impact

The bidding mechanism might be abused if the used stable coin is depegged for a while - like USDC did it early 2023 - and the bidders can have advantage accordingly.

### Mitigation

It's better to add `whenNotPaused` modifier.
