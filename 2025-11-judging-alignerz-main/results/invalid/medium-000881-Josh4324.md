# [000881] Missing Access Control on Distribution Functions
  
  ### Summary

The functions distributeRewardTVS() and distributeStablecoinAllocation() are intended to allow only the owner to distribute unclaimed rewards (TVS tokens or stablecoin allocations) to KOLs after the claim deadline.

However, both functions lack the onlyOwner modifier, meaning any external caller can invoke them and trigger reward distribution logic.
