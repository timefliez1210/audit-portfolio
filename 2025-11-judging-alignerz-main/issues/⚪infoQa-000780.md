# [000780] Unnecessary Storage Data Location for Read-Only Access
  
  ### Summary

Inefficient use of storage data location will cause unnecessary gas consumption for users interacting with the `claimRewardTVS`, `claimStablecoinAllocation`, `distributeRewardTVS`, and `distributeStablecoinAllocation` functions as the contract loads data from storage into a storage-referenced variable when only reading is required.

### Root Cause

In AlignerzVesting.sol, the functions unnecessarily declare `rewardProject` with the `storage` keyword even though the variable is only read from, not written to. When a variable is only read, using the `memory` data location is more gas-efficient as it avoids unnecessary storage access operations.
Instances at `claimRewardTVS`, `claimStablecoinAllocation`, `distributeRewardTVS`, `distributeStablecoinAllocation`.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This is not an attack path but rather a gas optimization issue.

1. User calls `claimRewardTVS`, `claimStablecoinAllocation`, `distributeRewardTVS`, or `distributeStablecoinAllocation`
2. The function declares a storage reference to `rewardProject`
3. The storage reference is used only to read the `claimDeadline` property
4. Unnecessary storage load operations are performed, consuming additional gas

### Impact

Users and protocol callers suffer an approximate loss of 100-300 gas per transaction on each of these four functions due to unnecessary storage operations. While individually minor, this accumulates across multiple calls to these frequently-used functions.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the `storage` keyword with `memory` for the `rewardProject` variable declarations in all four functions since the variable is only read, not modified.
