# [000801] Unnecessary Unchecked Increment Pattern in For Loops (Solidity ≥0.8.22)
  
  ### Summary

Manual unchecked increments in for loops will cause unnecessary code verbosity and potential developer confusion for the protocol as developers continue using an outdated optimization pattern that is now automatically handled by the Solidity compiler since version 0.8.22.


### Root Cause

The choice to manually wrap loop counter increments in `unchecked` blocks is unnecessary as the Solidity compiler automatically optimizes for loop counter increments since version 0.8.22 ([release announcement](https://www.soliditylang.org/blog/2023/10/25/solidity-0.8.22-release-announcement/)). This creates additional code complexity without providing any gas savings.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

This is a gas optimization, not an attack vector. However, the issue manifests as:

1. Developer writes a for loop with manual `unchecked { ++i }` increment
2. Compiler automatically applies the same optimization regardless of the unchecked block
3. The unchecked block adds unnecessary lines of code without benefit
4. Code reviewers and maintainers must parse additional syntax that provides no value


### Impact

The protocol incurs no actual gas cost penalty, as the compiler optimizes both patterns identically. However, the codebase suffers from:
- Increased code verbosity (3 lines instead of 1 for each loop increment)
- Reduced readability and maintainability
- Potential developer confusion about optimization requirements

**Affected locations:**
- `A26ZDividendDistributor.sol`: `getTotalUnclaimedAmounts()`, `getUnclaimedAmounts()`, `_setDividends()`
- `AlignerzVesting.sol`: `distributeRewardTVS()`, `distributeStablecoinAllocation()`, `distributeRemainingRewardTVS()`, `distributeRemainingStablecoinAllocation()`, `splitTVS()`, `_computeSplitArrays()`
- `WhitelistManager.sol`: `enableWhitelists()`, `disableWhitelists()`, `addUsersToWhitelist()`, `removeUsersFromWhitelist()`


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the manual unchecked blocks from for loops and use the standard increment pattern.
This simplifies the code while maintaining identical gas efficiency on Solidity 0.8.22+.
