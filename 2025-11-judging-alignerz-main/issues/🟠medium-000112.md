# [000112] Integer division truncation in splitTVS will cause a permanent lock of token dust for the protocol
  
  ### Summary

Integer division truncation in AlignerzVesting.sol will cause a permanent lock of token dust for the protocol as users split their TVSs.

### Root Cause

In src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol, the splitTVS function calculates split amounts using (amount * percentage) / BASIS_POINT. This floors the result, leaving small remainders (dust) unaccounted for.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1-User splits a TVS where the amount is not perfectly divisible by the percentage basis points.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1-User calls splitTVS on an amount of 1000 with a 33.33% split (3 parts).
2-Each part gets 333. Total = 999.
3-1 token is lost from the Allocation struct but remains in the contract balance.


### Impact

The protocol suffers an accumulation of trapped funds ("dust") that cannot be withdrawn or claimed by anyone.


### PoC

```solidity
// See test_PoC_6_Split_DustCreation in AlignerzAdditionalPoC.t.sol
function test_PoC_6_Split_DustCreation() public {
    // ... setup ...
    uint256 originalAmount = 1000;
    // Split into 3 parts
    uint256 totalNewAmount = 999;
    assertLt(totalNewAmount, originalAmount, "Tokens were lost during split");
}
```


### Mitigation

Ensure the sum of split amounts equals the original amount by assigning the remainder to the final split portion.
