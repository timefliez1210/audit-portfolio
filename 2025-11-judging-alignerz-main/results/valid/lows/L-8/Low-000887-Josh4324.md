# [000887] Non-Pausable Transfers in AlignerzNFT Contract
  
  ### Summary

The AlignerzNFT contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's Pausable library to allow the owner to pause minting and burning operations via the whenNotPaused modifier. However, token transfers are not restricted during the paused state. The comment on the pause and unpause function indicates that the pause functionality should work on minting and transfer, but this is not the case.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/dualguard/2025-11-alignerz/blob/main/protocol/src/contracts/nft/ERC721A.sol#L297-L304

The transferFrom and safeTransferFrom are not overridden in the AlignerzNFT to add the whenNotPaused modifier, so transfer will occur in the contract irrespective of if the contract is paused or not.
