# [000425] Malicious KOL Can block `distributeRemainingRewardTVS`, causing permanent loss of rewards for other KOLs
  
  ### Summary

A malicious KOL (e.g., a KOL dissatisfied with their allocation) can deliberately cause their ERC721 `onERC721Received` fallback function to revert.

### Root Cause

In `AlignerzVesting.sol:558` to `AlignerzVesting.sol:576`, `distributeRemainingRewardTVS` attempts to distribute NFTs to multiple KOLs within a single call, a revert in one recipient’s fallback will cause the entire transaction to revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

This issue can occur if there are KOLs who fail to claim their rewards before the `claimDeadline`.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A malicious KOL can deliberately cause their ERC721 `onERC721Received` fallback function to revert, which in turn can cause the entire batch call transaction to fail.

### Impact

All KOLs who fail to claim their rewards before the `claimDeadline` will be unable to receive their allocated rewards. However, the impact is low because rewards can still be distributed to KOLs individually using the `distributeRewardTVS` function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Wrap each mint call in the `distributeRemainingRewardTVS` function within a try-catch block to ensure that a failure in one KOL’s mint does not revert the entire transaction.
