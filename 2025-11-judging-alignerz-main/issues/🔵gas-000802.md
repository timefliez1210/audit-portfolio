# [000802] Unused Import in AlignerzVesting Contract Increases Deployment Cost
  
  ### Summary

An unnecessary import statement will cause increased deployment costs for the protocol as the contract includes an unused interface import.


### Root Cause

In AlignerzVesting.sol the contract imports `IAlignerzVesting` interface which is never utilized within the contract code, resulting in unnecessary bytecode being included in the deployment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This is a gas optimization issue, not an attack vector. The impact is:
1. Developer deploys AlignerzVesting contract with unused import
2. Solidity compiler includes unnecessary interface data in the compiled bytecode
3. Deployment transaction costs more gas than necessary


### Impact

The protocol suffers a small increase in deployment costs due to the inclusion of unused import statements in the compiled bytecode. While the impact is minimal per contract, removing unused imports is a best practice for gas optimization.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the unused import statement from `AlignerzVesting.sol`
