# [000113] The limitation of auto-generated getters in AlignerzVesting.sol will cause a complete loss of dividend rewards for TVS holders
  
  ### Summary

The limitation of Solidity auto-generated getters in AlignerzVesting.sol will cause a calculation error in A26ZDividendDistributor.sol resulting in zero rewards for all TVS holders.


### Root Cause

In src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol, allocationOf is declared as a public mapping. The auto-generated getter function returns the struct but omits dynamic arrays (amounts, vestingPeriods). The Distributor contract expects these arrays to be populated.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1-A26ZDividendDistributor calls vesting.allocationOf(nftId).


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1-Owner calls setUpTheDividends.
2-Distributor calls vesting.allocationOf.
3-The returned struct has empty arrays for amounts.
4-The loop for (uint i; i < len;) does not execute.
5-Unclaimed amount is calculated as 0.

### Impact

Users suffer a 100% loss of their entitled dividend rewards.


### PoC

```solidity
function test_PoC_5_Dividend_GetterBug_ReturnsZero() public {
    setUpPoC();
    _setupAndMintNFT(bidders[0]);
    uint256 nftId = bidderNFTIds[bidders[0]];

    // Call reverts because Interface expects Struct (with arrays) 
    // but Contract returns Primitives (without arrays) -> ABI Decoding Error
    vm.expectRevert();
    distributor.getUnclaimedAmounts(nftId);
}
``` 

### Mitigation

Manually implement the getter in AlignerzVesting.sol:
```solidity
function getAllocation(uint256 nftId) external view returns (Allocation memory) {
    return allocationOf[nftId];
}
```
