# [001025] Unbounded Loop in Dividend Setup (DoS)
  
  ### Summary

An unbounded loop will cause a denial of service for the protocol as the dividend setup transaction will exceed the block gas limit once the collection grows.

### Root Cause

In `A26ZDividendDistributor.sol`, `setUpTheDividends` calls `getTotalUnclaimedAmounts` and `_setDividends`. Both functions iterate over `totalMinted NFTs. getUnclaimedAmounts` performs expensive storage writes (SSTORE).

### Internal Pre-conditions

The number of minted NFTs exceeds approximately 1,200.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls `setUpTheDividends`.
2. The gas required exceeds the block gas limit (30M).
3. The transaction reverts.

### Impact

The owner cannot distribute dividends. The feature becomes permanently unusable.

### PoC

Nil

### Mitigation

Implement a batched processing pattern where the owner can calculate and set dividends in chunks (e.g., 100 users per transaction).
