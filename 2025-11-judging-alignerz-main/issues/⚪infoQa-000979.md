# [000979] Missing sanity check in initialize() [Informational]
  
  
### Summary

The missing validation of the treasury address in multiple token transfer functions will cause a denial of service for users as functions will revert when attempting to transfer tokens to the uninitialized treasury address (address(0)).

### Root cause

In `protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L352-L359` the `initialize()` function does not set the treasury address, leaving it as the default value of `address(0)`. Multiple functions then attempt to transfer tokens to this address without validating that it is non-zero, causing reverts with standard ERC20 implementations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to deploy the contract without calling `setTreasury()` to set the treasury address to remain `address(0)`
2. Owner needs to call functions like `launchBiddingProject()` to create projects that enable user interactions

### External pre-conditions

None required.

### Attack path

1. User calls `placeBid()` with a non-zero `bidFee` set, triggering the transfer to treasury at `protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L728`
2. User calls `updateBid()` with a non-zero `updateBidFee` set, triggering the transfer to treasury at `protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L770`
3. User calls `mergeTVS()` which always attempts to transfer fees to treasury at `protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L1023`
4. User calls `splitTVS()` which always attempts to transfer fees to treasury at `protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L1071`
5. Owner calls `withdrawPostDeadlineProfit()` which transfers profits to treasury at `protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L919`

### Impact

The users cannot successfully execute core contract functions like placing bids, updating bids, merging TVS, or splitting TVS when treasury remains unset. The owner cannot withdraw profits from projects. With standard ERC20 implementations that revert on transfers to address(0), all these functions will fail until the treasury is properly configured through `setTreasury()`.

### Mitigation

Consider adding validation to ensure the treasury address is non-zero before attempting token transfers. One approach could be to add a simple check `require(treasury != address(0), Zero_Address())` in functions that transfer to the treasury address, or implement a centralized validation function that checks treasury validity before any transfer operations.
