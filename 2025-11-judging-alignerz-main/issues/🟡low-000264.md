# [000264] Permanent ETH Locking Due to Missing Withdrawal Mechanism
  
  ### Summary

The AlignerzVesting contract contains a payable receive() function that accepts incoming ETH but provides no mechanism to withdraw or transfer these funds. Any ETH sent to the contract becomes permanently locked and irrecoverable.

### Root Cause

The contract implements:

```solidity
receive() external payable {
    emit EtherReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
}
```
However, there are no corresponding withdrawal functions that allow ETH to be transferred out of the contract. While the contract has withdrawStuckTokens() for ERC20 tokens and withdrawStuckETH() for ETH, these are onlyOwner functions and don't help regular users who accidentally send ETH.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Payable receive() function exists without withdrawal mechanism
2. withdrawStuckETH() function is onlyOwner and inaccessible to users
3. No user-accessible ETH recovery functions implemented
4. Contract can accept and hold ETH balance indefinitely
5. Fallback function reverts but doesn't prevent ETH transfers

### External Pre-conditions

User
1. Any Ethereum address can send ETH to contract
2. No authentication or permissions required for ETH transfers
3. Standard ETH transfer operations work normally
4. Multiple transfer methods available (direct, call, selfdestruct)
5. No special technical knowledge required

*Network/System Conditions*
1. Ethereum network supports standard ETH transfers
2. Contract address is valid and active on network
3. Normal gas operations for ETH transfers
4. Third-party protocols can interact with contract
5. Wallets and DApps can misconfigure transaction

### Attack Path

1. Direct Transfer: Users accidentally send ETH instead of tokens
2. Selfdestruct Forcing: Malicious contracts can forcibly send ETH via selfdestruct
3. Integration Errors: Third-party protocols might send ETH during normal operations
4. Miner Transactions: Block rewards or transaction fees accidentally sent to contract

### Impact

Permanent fund loss for any user who accidentally sends ETH to the contract

No recovery mechanism for mistakenly sent funds

Reputation damage as the protocol appears poorly designed

Potential legal liability for lost user funds

Attack Vectors

### PoC

```javascript 
// This ETH becomes permanently inaccessible
await sender.sendTransaction({
    to: vestingContractAddress,
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0")
});
```
