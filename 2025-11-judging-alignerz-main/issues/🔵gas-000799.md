# [000799] Redundant `merkleRoot` Check Causes Unnecessary Gas Usage in `finalizeBids`
  
  ### Summary

A redundant equality check on `merkleRoot` will cause unnecessary gas consumption for all vesting pool initializations as the owner finalizes a project, since the function performs an extra state read that provides no additional safety.


### Root Cause

In `AlignerzVesting.sol: finalizeBids`, the line  
`require(biddingProject.vestingPools[poolId].merkleRoot == bytes32(0), Merkle_Root_Already_Set());`  
performs a redundant check. By design, `merkleRoot` is unset until project finalization, meaning the check introduces an unnecessary storage read without contributing to correctness. Removing this check saves gas on every pool initialization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

(Not an attack — gas inefficiency)
1. Owner calls `finalizeBids()` to finalize a project.
2. For each vesting pool, the contract reads `vestingPools[poolId].merkleRoot` from storage.
3. This value is always `bytes32(0)` before finalization, making the require check redundant and wasteful.


### Impact

The protocol pays unnecessary gas due to an avoidable SLOAD in every pool iteration.  
If a project has *N* vesting pools, *N* redundant storage reads occur, increasing the cost of finalization proportionally.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the redundant `require` statement.

Since `merkleRoot` is by definition unset prior to finalization, the assignment alone is sufficient.
