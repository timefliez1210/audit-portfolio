# [001026] Pause Mechanism Failure
  
  ### Summary

An incomplete pause implementation will cause a security bypass for the protocol as attackers will still be able to transfer assets while the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

In `AlignerzNFT.sol`, the `pause` function is implemented, but the contract inherits from `ERC721A` without overriding the `_beforeTokenTransfers` hook to check the pause status.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner calls pause().

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker exploits a different bug to mint tokens.
2. Owner pauses the contract.
3. Attacker calls transferFrom to move tokens to a safe wallet.
4. The transfer succeeds despite the pause.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of security posture and cannot contain exploits effectively.

### PoC

Nil

### Mitigation

Override `_beforeTokenTransfers` and add r`equire(!paused())`.
