# [001028] Missing Minter Role Permissions
  
  ### Summary

A missing role assignment will cause a complete denial of service for the protocol and users as the vesting contract will revert on all attempts to issue NFTs.

### Root Cause

In `AlignerzVesting.sol`, the contract attempts to call `nftContract.mint()`. However, in `AlignerzNFT.sol`, the mint function is restricted by the `onlyMinter` modifier. The `AlignerzVesting` contract is never programmatically granted this role upon deployment or initialization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The AlignerzNFT contract needs to be deployed.
2. The AlignerzVesting contract needs to be deployed and initialized with the NFT contract address.
3. The owner must not have manually called addMinter on the NFT contract to approve the Vesting contract.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `placeBid` and wins an allocation.
2. The owner calls `finalizeBids`.
3. The user calls `claimNFT` to receive their vesting position.
4. The transaction reverts because `AlignerzVesting` does not have the minter role

### Impact

The protocol cannot execute any core functionality related to issuing vesting positions. The user cannot mint NFTs. The protocol suffers a total loss of functionality.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Ensure the deployment script calls `alignerzNFT.addMinter(address(alignerzVesting))` immediately after deploying both contracts.
