# [001067] Missing Storage Gap in ALignerzVesting Contract May Cause Future Storage Collision
  
  ### Summary

The AlignerzVesting contract is written as an upgradeable contract but does not include a storage gap. In future updates if this contract is inherited by other contract then in later upgrades any changes to this contract will create storage collisions


### Root Cause

https://github.com/dualguard/2025-11-alignerz/blob/f7eeed88d91356484c02af6f38b71f27b790828c/protocol/src/contracts/vesting/AlignerzVesting.sol#L18

The above contract is upgradable but it doesnt have any implemenation of gaps to prevent any data corruption in future upgrades.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin upgrades the current contract and it is inherited by other contract directly.
2. Admin makes second upgrade making changes to the current version of `AlignerzVesting`.

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin upgrades the current contract and it is inherited by other contract directly.
2. Admin makes second upgrade making changes to the current version of `AlignerzVesting`.

### Impact

This will lead to storage slot collision and effectively leads to data corruption

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
contract AlignerzVesting{
    .
    .
    .
    .
    function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyOwner {}
    .
+    uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```
