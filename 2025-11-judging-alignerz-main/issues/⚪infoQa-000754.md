# [000754] The check in `createPool` allows creating 11 pools despite `Cannot_Exceed_Ten_Pools_Per_Project` limit
  
  ### Summary

The pool count guard in `createPool` is off by one, so the contract allows creating 11 pools even though the error name and requirement suggest a hard cap of 10.

### Root Cause

In `createPool`, the code checks `biddingProject.poolCount <= 10` before incrementing `poolCount`, which permits creating the 11th pool when `poolCount == 10`:

```solidity
BiddingProject storage biddingProject = biddingProjects[projectId];
require(!biddingProject.closed, Project_Already_Closed());
>> require(biddingProject.poolCount <= 10, Cannot_Exceed_Ten_Pools_Per_Project());  

biddingProject.token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), totalAllocation);

uint256 poolId = biddingProject.poolCount;
...
biddingProject.poolCount++;
```

This condition allows `poolCount` to reach 11, conflicting with the error name and may be any off-chain assumptions about a maximum of 10 pools per project.

### Impact

A potential UX/spec inconsistency. Nothing is broken

### Mitigation

Change the guard to `require(biddingProject.poolCount < 10, Cannot_Exceed_Ten_Pools_Per_Project());` so that only pool IDs `0..9` (10 pools total) are allowed.
OR change the error code and the NATSPEC.
