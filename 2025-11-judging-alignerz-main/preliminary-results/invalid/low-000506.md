# [000506] `ownerOf()` View Function Reverts Instead of Returning Error Value ->> Non-EIP721 Compliant Behavior
  
  ### Summary

The `ownerOf()` function reverts when querying non-existent tokens instead of returning a graceful error value. Since the README explicitly states "No" to EIP compliance, this revert behavior could break integrations expecting error returns rather than reverts from view functions.


### Root Cause

The `ownerOf()` function calls `_ownershipOf()` which reverts with `OwnerQueryForNonexistentToken()` when:
- Token ID is outside valid range (`tokenId < _startTokenId()` or `tokenId >= _currentIndex`)
- Token has been burned (`ownership.burned == true`)

```solidity
function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view override returns (address) {
    return _ownershipOf(tokenId).addr; // Will revert if token doesn't exist
}

function _ownershipOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (TokenOwnership memory) {
    // ... validation logic ...
    revert OwnerQueryForNonexistentToken(); // Reverts instead of returning error
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract does not claim EIP-721 compliance (per README).


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Users calls `ownerOf(tokenId)` for non-existent/burned token
2. `_ownershipOf()` validation fails
3. Function reverts with custom error


### Impact

Inconsistent with "No EIP compliance" statement in README. Because in README mention not comply with any specific EIPS. So that point of view this is a issue. If mention that comply with ERC721 then it is expected behaviour. So I think it should be Low severity issue according dualguard rules for judging.
